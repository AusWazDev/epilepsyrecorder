# MER — Design Audit

**Written 31 August 2026, AEST.** A whole-app design audit, from the 430×932 capture set at
`715ca95`, the code as it stands this session, and `DESCRIPTION-430.md`.

**Findings are recorded, not repaired. Nothing here was fixed while writing it.**

---

## ⛔ HOW TO READ THIS: THE EVIDENCE IS NOT ALL THE SAME QUALITY

Every finding carries one of three marks. **A reader who cannot tell them apart will trust them
equally, and they are not equal.**

| Mark | Means |
|---|---|
| **Code-verified** | Checked against the repository this session. Locations re-derived, not trusted from a note |
| **Seen directly** | Read from the captures — four screens at 375, 430 and 800 |
| **Described** | From `DESCRIPTION-430.md`, which was **one reading with a recount, not a blind second opinion** |

⚠️ **Why this matters, from this audit's own drafting.** An earlier draft recommended *"wrap the
filter sheet's chip row"*, on the strength of a **described** observation that the date-range chips
ran off the right edge. **The description was accurate.** The inference drawn from it — that a chip
was therefore unreachable — was not: the row is a deliberate horizontal `ListView` and the chip is
reached by scrolling. **The observation survived; the recommendation was withdrawn.**

⭐ **That is the whole point of the marks.** A described finding tells you what was on a screen. It
does not tell you why, and the gap between the two is where a recommendation goes wrong.

---

## 1. Diagnosis — the chip wall was a symptom, not the problem

**The app has no component vocabulary.** Twelve screens carry roughly a dozen one-off patterns,
each locally correct and none shared. **Every screen was solved; nothing was solved once.**

⭐ **That is why the bounded-picker fix cost two call sites: there was never one picker.** The same
is true of every fix that follows — each will cost as many implementations as the pattern has
copies, and the count is not knowable from any one screen.

**Described.** Four add affordances: a floating button on Medication, inline text on Conditions, a
pill in the wizard and the form, and a tile inside the form's event-type grid. Event types are
**chips** in the wizard and **bordered cards** on the form. Section labels are **sentence case** in
the wizard and the medication sheet, **small caps** on the form, History and Help. The date control
is a **chip** in the medication sheet and a **card with a "Set" link** everywhere else. Destructive
**Delete** and confirmatory **Save** are both filled blue, with **no red anywhere**. "Cancel" is an
outlined button in two places and a text "Keep editing" in the confirm dialog. Dropdowns exist only
on Conditions, a hero band only on About, an accordion only on Help, a floating button only on
Medication.

⚠️ **Correction to an earlier draft.** Severity is **not** a different control kind between the two
paths. **Seen directly**, it is the same pill idiom at a larger size on the form. **Prominence, not
kind** — and the distinction matters, because "different control for the same job" and "same
control at two sizes" call for different fixes.

⭐ **The app already contains its own answer.** `your-data__default` is **two cards built to one
template** — icon, title, body, action — and it is the most internally consistent screen in the
set. **That template generalises**, and a component vocabulary can be derived from it rather than
invented.

---

## 2. The row bound cuts an unranked list

### ⭐ First, plainly: THE BOUND IS RIGHT. Do not remove it.

**Code-verified.** `BoundedChipWrap` bounds **by rows, not by count**. `_rowsOf` packs chips
sequentially by width in list order, and a chip renders only if
`_expanded || rows[i] < _maxRows || _pinned[i]`.

**So list order decides membership of the visible rows, not merely sequence within them** —
promoting an entry pulls it inside the fold and pushes another out. `_pinned` exempts **selected
chips, orphan values a record already holds, and the add pill**, so a picker grows past three rows
rather than ever hiding what the record contains.

**That architecture is correct.** It is the reason the questions beneath the pickers became
reachable at all. ⛔ **Nobody should read this section and plan to remove the bound. The bound is
not the fault. The ranking beneath it is inert.**

### The ranking is inert on the list where the bound bites hardest

**Code-verified.**

| Mechanism | Beforehand | Afterwards |
|---|---|---|
| **Usage** — rank 1, all-time, per record, snapshot at load | **Active — reorders today** | Active, but **every offerable value scores zero** |
| **Relevance** — rank 2, static `const` map | **Inert** — no trigger mapping, and no `seeded_key` writer | **Inert** — mapping exists, no `seeded_key` writer |

**Usage outranks relevance deliberately**, so an entry recorded twenty times cannot sink below one
never touched. **Relevance was built for cold start**, when every usage count ties and it therefore
decides the whole list.

⛔ **Relevance is dormant on every device that can exist.** `addCondition` writes
`'seeded_key': null` and nothing else assigns it, so `_adoptedKeys` is always empty and
`relevantValues` returns the empty set.

⛔ **Afterwards scores zero** because existing records reference the **retired glyph-bearing legacy
values**, which `offerable` filters out as inactive **before** sorting. **So the afterwards list is
in pure seed order, and the three-row bound is cutting it by seed position and label width.**

### The consequence, seen directly

| | Afterwards | Beforehand |
|---|---|---|
| Wizard, 430 *(described)* | 7 of 34 | 8 of 32 |
| Form, 430 *(described)* | 9 of 34 | 9 of 32 |
| **Form, 800** *(seen directly)* | **12 of 34** | **12 of 32** |

⭐ **At 800 the afterwards row reaches `Anxious`, `Angry` and `Irritable`. At 430 it does not.**

**The psychological and behavioural observations are the ones that fall off a phone.** A carer on a
phone is offered a physical vocabulary; the same person on a tablet is offered an emotional one.
**That is a difference in what the record can contain, decided by device width and label length.**

### A standing property, not an incident

**Append-only retirement and usage ranking are each correct and interact badly.** A user's own
history stops informing what they are offered at **any** vocabulary migration, silently, and the
symptom is **a list quietly reverting to seed order** — no error, nothing missing, just a ranking
that no longer ranks.

⚠️ **Any future relabelling does it again**, to whichever entries it touches, and it will present
identically.

---

## 3. The review step reviews nothing

**Seen directly.** `wizard-5-summary` carries the app-bar title **"Check and save"** and,
immediately beneath it, the page heading **"Check and save"** — printed twice with nothing between.

Below that sits the "When it happened" card, then **a single line: "• Duration: not recorded"**,
set as small unstyled text with a literal bullet glyph.

⛔ **That line lists what is missing, not what was entered.** Type, severity, observations,
beforehand and notes are **echoed nowhere before save, in either path.**

The screen is roughly **56 % empty at 430**, **37 % at 375**, and **about three-quarters void at
800** — so the tablet gets the worst version of the app's confirmation screen.

⭐ **The screen titled "Check and save" cannot be used to check, and is the emptiest screen in the
app.** It also carries the least discoverable capability in the app — see §4.

---

## 4. Backdating exists, is well built, and is buried

**Code-verified.** `occurredAt` is set through `showDatePicker` then `showTimePicker`, from
`occurred_at_field.dart`, on **both** paths: inline after Duration on the form, and on the summary
step in the wizard. Range **2020 to now**. It is read by the export, History (six sites), the
backup and the change list.

⭐ **Two implementation decisions are correct and must survive any redesign:**

1. **A future time is refused, not clamped** — *"That time has not happened yet. Nothing was
   changed."* **Clamping would store a time the user did not choose** and show it back as though
   they had.
2. **`Clear` restores null, meaning "not asked"** — not "it happened now".

**Code-verified.** The **iOS native quick-log path writes nothing for it, and that is right** — a
quick-log record is captured as it happens, so "not asked" is the honest value. **The end-drain
rebuild carries the field**, so a backdated record does not lose it when its duration arrives
later.

⛔ **The problem is depth, not presence. The emptiest screen in the app carries the least
discoverable capability in the app.**

---

## 5. The quick-log record is displayed as awaiting repair

**Code-verified.** In `history_screen.dart` the row subtitle is built from:

```dart
if (isIncomplete(r))
  'Needs: ${missingFields(r).join(", ")}',
…
if (r.eventType != null) _EventTypeBadge(type: r.eventType!),
```

`missingFields` is generated **from absent fields** — `duration`, `eventType`, `severity`. So a
timestamp-only record renders as a time, the text **"Needs: duration, type, severity"**, and **no
badge**, where complete records carry one.

That row is the output of the primary action: **one tap, nothing gated, a timestamp and nothing
else.**

### ⚠️ AND THE DESIGN WAS DELIBERATE. THE COUNTER-ARGUMENT IS IN THE CODE

> *"A quick-record shows a timestamp and almost nothing else; in a mixed list that reads as
> variation, but in a FILTERED list of them every row differs only by time and the screen reads as
> broken rather than as a work queue.*
>
> *Naming the gaps turns the list into something a user can ACT on: which row to open, and what it
> will ask. **It is PRESENTATION — the fields are already null and the row already omits them — not
> interpretation.***
>
> *Shown in a mixed list too, deliberately. A row that only explained itself while a filter was on
> would make the filter the only way to understand the list."*

⭐ **That argument is right about the filtered list.** A screen of quick-logs where every row
differs only by time genuinely does read as broken, and the line is what makes it a work queue.

**The disagreement is narrower than an earlier draft of this audit made it.** It is about the
**mixed list** — where the comment itself concedes the rows read as *variation*, and shows the line
anyway to avoid making the filter the only explanation. **The cost of that choice is that a carer
who quick-logs during an event opens History and meets a deficiency notice on the thing they just
did correctly.**

⚠️ **This is a trade between two real failure modes, not an oversight**, and a reader who disagrees
with this audit should be able to see why from the quotation above.

⭐ **A component vocabulary may dissolve the tension rather than resolve it.** A row treatment that
reads as **awaiting detail** rather than **missing fields** would serve the work-queue case without
the deficiency tone — the information is identical and only the register changes. **An observation
about where this might land, not a recommendation.**

---

## 6. Notes is inverted

**Described.** Ranked by depth from the top of its screen:

| | | |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | medication add sheet | two-thirds down, **no scrolling** |
| 2 | wizard step 4 | 78 % down, **no scrolling** |
| 3 | form | **second screen** — a full screen of scrolling first |

**Absent everywhere else, and never echoed before save** in either path.

⛔ **Notes is the only place a carer records what no chip covers.** It is **most reachable in the
secondary feature and least reachable in the primary capture path.**

---

## 7. Home is well composed and loses it with height

**Seen directly.** At **375** this is the best-composed screen in the app: clean hierarchy, one
orange primary, one blue secondary, informational cards descending in weight.

At **430** there is roughly **150 px of void above "Record Event"**. At **800** there is around
**350 px above and 370 px below**, so **the primary action sits below the vertical midpoint** and
**the first thing a tablet user sees on opening MER is empty space.**

⭐ **The content is centred rather than anchored.** A small change with a large effect on first
impression, **and independent of every open decision in this document.**

---

## 8. Smaller findings

- **Seen directly.** **Three icon idioms on one screen:** every afterwards chip carries a coloured
  emoji, every beforehand chip carries none, and event-type cards carry line icons. ⚠️ Separately,
  **a tone question never decided explicitly** — the export goes to a neurologist, and the emoji
  are semantically loose (a battery for "Weak" is a metaphor).
- **Seen directly.** **Two selected-states on one screen:** salmon fill with an orange border for
  event type, solid blue fill for severity.
- **Seen directly.** **Orange does three jobs** — the "Record Event" block, the form's selected
  card, and the "62" statistic. On home it means *tap this*; **using it on a figure weakens the
  only strong signal the app has.**
- **Seen directly.** **Three app-bar patterns:** title plus "Record · Review · Share", title plus
  "Medical Event Recorder", and title alone.
- **Seen directly.** **"Days since" has no referent** — a bare `3` between "Total saved" and
  "Referrals".
- **Seen directly.** **Three product names across the set:** Medical Event Recorder, MER, Notiva.
- **Described.** **"Not set" is internal state used as a group heading**, in wizard step 2 — which
  is also the unbounded picker, and the grouped path a second condition switches on.
- **Described.** **"Show" appears three times with two meanings** on the vocabulary screen in
  selection mode.
- ⚠️ **Code-verified, and a CORRECTION to an earlier draft of this audit.** The filter sheet's
  date-range chips are a **deliberate horizontal `ListView`** (`scrollDirection: Axis.horizontal`),
  **not a clipped row — no chip is unreachable.** What remains is an **inconsistency**: every other
  chip row on that sheet is a `Wrap`, and one of them carries a comment explaining why it was made
  one. **This row alone scrolls.**
  ⭐ **The shape of my error is worth more than the finding.** The description said only that the
  row ran off the edge, which was accurate. **The unreachable chip was an inference I added, and
  the recommendation built on it has been withdrawn.**
- **Code-verified.** **The History delete control has no tooltip, on every row**, so it renders
  `content-desc=""` and a screen reader announces nothing for a destructive action.
  `medication_screen` builds the same control **with** `tooltip: 'Delete'`. ⛔ **An inconsistency,
  not a house style — which is what makes it a defect.** Fixing it also unblocks the one capture
  that could not be taken.
- ✅ **Code-verified, NO DEFECT.** The Help notification card is **Android-only and further gated on
  notifications being allowed**. **Windows gets a replacement section rather than a gap**, with the
  reasoning recorded in the code: *"a Windows user who finds nothing here cannot tell whether the
  section is missing or the feature is absent."* ⭐ **That pattern should be borrowed elsewhere.**
  ⚠️ One real gap: **the switch is hidden when Android notifications are denied**, so the user who
  most needs to discover the setting cannot.

---

## 9. Routed to the adviser, unresolved

- ⛔ **The CSV cannot distinguish a backdated record from a live-logged one.** Seventeen columns,
  all three time columns are `whenHappened`, **no logged-at column**, nothing marking the
  distinction and no way to infer it. `isBackdated` is defined and **has no caller as at 31 August
  2026**. **Recall reliability is clinically material, and the model already holds the fact.**
  ⚠️ **Not resolved by adding a column, because that would be deciding it.**
- **"Days since"** — a derived, unlabelled and emotionally loaded figure, on an app positioned as
  capture-only.

---

## 10. Recommendations, in order

**Decisions first. No code.**

### Three decisions

**1. Does `LogEventScreen` survive?**

**Code-verified, and this replaces an earlier framing of "two capture paths", which was a
mis-description.** They are **two EDIT paths split by record completeness**:

```dart
wantsWizard(r) ? EventWizardScreen(existing: r) : LogEventScreen(existing: r)
wantsWizard(r) => r.detailsCompleted == false || isIncomplete(r)
```

**An incomplete record opens the wizard; a complete one opens the form.** Both call sites pass an
`existing`, so **today it is edit-only by call site, not by construction** — `existing` is
`EventRecord?` with no `required`, so **the screen is one optional argument away from becoming a
genuine second capture path.**

⭐ **The routing itself is the decision worth revisiting.** Whether completeness is the right axis
on which to hand a user two different field orders, two control kinds and two densities is a
question someone should answer deliberately, because **every field added is currently built twice,
in two idioms, for one entity.**

**2. How do episode and daily records coexist?** History, the export and the entry point all assume
one kind. **`daily_entry` is not a screen to add** — it is a second record shape that every one of
those surfaces has to accommodate.

**3. Give `seeded_key` a writer.** ⭐ **This is what conditions adoption was for.** It makes
relevance live, which **fixes cold start and the afterwards list at once**, and it is **smaller
than the layout work.**

⚠️ **And it belongs ahead of the layout work, not after it: a bound cutting a RANKED list is a
different design problem from a bound cutting seed order.** Solving the layout against the current
behaviour would be solving the wrong problem.

### Then the component vocabulary

One add affordance · one selection control per cardinality · one label case · one date control ·
**one destructive treatment visually distinct from confirmation** · one disclosure · one icon
idiom.

**Built from the `your-data` template**, which already exists and already works.

⭐ **This is the redesign, and it is what makes `injury`, `aura` and `laterality` cheap to add
rather than expensive.**

### Then six fixes that depend on none of the above

1. **Stop rendering quick-log records as deficient** — see §5 for the counter-argument that must be
   answered, not bypassed.
2. **Give the summary step a real summary**, and surface backdating properly on it.
3. **Raise notes, and echo it before save.**
4. **Anchor home rather than centring it.**
5. **Bound wizard step 2**, both the plain and the grouped paths.
6. **Label the delete control.**

*(An earlier draft listed seven. "Wrap the filter sheet's chip row" was withdrawn — the row scrolls
deliberately and nothing is unreachable.)*

### Then the layout work

**With decisions 1 to 3 answered.** ⭐ **Which is why option (b) beat option (a):** the outstanding
features are not small, and building them into a layout already thought messy means reworking them
twice.

---

## 11. Open question, not for this pass

**Whether the retired legacy values can be mapped forward to their current equivalents.**

That would **restore usage ranking on the afterwards list** for this user and for anyone carrying
history across the migration. **Append-only means the old values still exist**, so it may be
tractable.

⚠️ **A question, not a proposal.** It touches stored values in every historical record, which is
the one thing this project has consistently refused to do.

---

## 12. ⭐ What is working, and must survive the redesign

**This document is almost entirely defects, and that is a distorted picture of an app where several
hard things are right.** A redesign that does not know what to preserve will break them.

- ✅ **The future-time refusal.** `OccurredAtField` **refuses** a future time and says so, rather
  than clamping it to now. **Clamping is how a wrong value becomes a plausible one.**
- ✅ **`Clear` means "not asked", not "now".** The distinction between an absent answer and a
  default is carried correctly through the whole model, and it is the reason the export can be
  trusted.
- ✅ **The Windows replacement section.** Rather than hiding the notification help on a platform
  that has none, Windows gets a section saying so — because *"a user who finds nothing here cannot
  tell whether the section is missing or the feature is absent."* **Borrow this pattern.**
- ✅ **`your-data`'s two-card template.** Two parallel cards, one job each, the difference between
  them stated in the body text. **The most internally consistent screen in the app, and the seed of
  the component vocabulary.**
- ✅ **Usage outranking relevance.** Evidence about this person beats a prior about people with the
  condition. **The ordering is right even though it is currently inert on one list.**
- ✅ **The row bound itself.** See §2 — it made the questions beneath the pickers reachable, and
  `_pinned` means it can never hide what a record already contains.
- ✅ **Home at 375.** The best-composed screen in the app. **The composition is right; only its
  behaviour at height is wrong.**

⛔ **None of these is an accident, and several were re-derived after being broken once. The
redesign's first job is to not lose them.**
